I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer engineering from Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University and Baku Engineering University, respectively. I have 3 years of experience in mobile and specifically Flutter technology.

I am currently working as a Senior Mobile Platforms Engineer at Azerconnect LLC.

I am the founder of [Azerbaijan Flutter Users Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/azfluttercommunity).

In my spare time, I write articles for [Flutter Community](https://medium.com/flutter-community) on Medium. In addition, on my personal [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenanYusubov), I share technical materials.

My future plans are to increase my knowledge of Software Engineering and create my own IT company. My biggest dreams are to work for the Flutter Team at Google and to be a Mobile Architect.
