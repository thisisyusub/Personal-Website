I am Flutter Engineer based in Azerbaijan. I have more than 3+ years of experience in this field. I am the founder of [Azerbaijan Flutter Users Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/azfluttercommunity).

I am an open source fan. I often write different codes and share them openly. I think helping others is also helping yourself. The main reason I created the Azerbaijan Flutter Users Community is to help learners and share my knowledge.

I am always interested in technology. I always try to learn something new. I am currently trying to improve my SQL knowledge and learn backend programming and become a Full Stack Software Engineer.

In my spare time, I write articles for [Flutter Community](https://medium.com/flutter-community) on Medium. In addition, on my personal [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenanYusubov), I share technical materials.

My future plans are to increase my knowledge of Software Engineering and create my own IT company. My biggest dreams are to work for the Flutter Team at Google and to be a Software Architect.
